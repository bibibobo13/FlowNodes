# 🌸 FlowNodes

> **Stoic Philosophy meets Geometric Logic.**

A unique task management ecosystem built with **Rust**, moving from a simple CLI to a beautiful Zen-inspired GUI.

## 📐 The Concept
Tasks are represented by **Polygons**:
- **Triangle (3 edges)**: Low complexity
- **Square (4 edges)**: Medium complexity
- **Pentagon (5+ edges)**: High complexity / Focus required

## 🧘 Stoic Integration
- Daily reflections
- "Amor Fati" motivation module
- Virtue-based task tracking

## 📅 The 140-Day Journey
I am 12 years old, and this is my path to mastering Rust.
- [ ] **Days 1-20**: Foundation & Persistence (CLI)
- [ ] **Days 20-60**: Terminal UI (Ratatui)
- [ ] **Days 60-100**: Zen GUI (egui/wgpu)
- [ ] **Days 100-140**: Stoic expansion & Launch
