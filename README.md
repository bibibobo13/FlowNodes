# 🌸 FlowNodes

> Stoic Philosophy meets Geometric Logic

A unique task management ecosystem built in Rust 🦀
Moving from simple CLI → Terminal UI → Zen GUI

## 📐 The Polygon Concept

Tasks are represented by their complexity:
* 🔺 Triangle (3 edges): Low complexity
* 🔷 Square (4 edges): Medium complexity  
* ⬟ Pentagon (5+ edges): High complexity

*"The more sides, the more focus required"*

## 🧘 Stoic Integration
* Daily Stoic reflections
* "Amor Fati" motivation
* Virtue-based tracking
* "The obstacle is the way"
